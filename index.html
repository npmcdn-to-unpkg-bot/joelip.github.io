      <h2 class="f1">Joe Lipper</h2>
      <p class="f3">
        Hello, and welcome to my <span class="i">very mediocre website&#8482;</span>. I hope at some point in the future it will be less mediocre, and perhaps, dare I say, somewhat <span class="i">professional</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="f3">
        For now, please enjoy a few links. Here is my <a href="https://twitter.com/joelipper">Twitter</a>, my <a href="https://github.com/joelip">GitHub</a>, and <a href="https://bloc.io">the place I currently work, Bloc&#42;</a>. I am web developer who leans toward frontend development, but work with Ruby and Rails frequently as well. If, by some terribly misguided desire, you have more interest in my work experience, you can find a copy of my r&eacute;sum&eacute;, <a href="docs/joe_lipper_resume_04_2016.pdf">here</a>.

        &#42;Hey, while we're talking about my employer, I just want to clear a few things up. If I end up writing anything here (and really, I <span class="i">fuckin' might</span>), it won't necessarily reflect the view of my employer. Hell, they should be asking <span class="i">me</span> what I think about this stuff anyway and publishing it for the world. You hear that Dave and Roshan? YOU HEAR ME.
      </p>
      <p class="real-small-text">
        &#42;&#42;I'm sorry, things got out of hand there. I didn't mean it. Please don't fire me. I'll see you guys at work tomorrow (or Monday if you're reading this on a weekend, but why are you reading it on a weekend).
